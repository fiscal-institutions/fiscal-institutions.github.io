# Comparative IFI Dataset

**A dataset on Independent Fiscal Institutions (IFIs)**

The Comparative Independent Fiscal Institutions Dataset (CifiD) provides information about the legal provisions that constitute the monitoring scope, powers and institutional design of forty-four expert monitoring bodies in thirty-nine countries, so-called *Independent Fiscal Institutions* (IFIs). The dataset covers legislative changes to these institutions until 2018.

**Indicators**

The CifiD contains items that refer to the institutional properties of fiscal monitoring bodies as defined in legislation, classified along the dimensions

* evaluation powers
* access to policymakers
* legal status
* operations
* leadership
* composition
* term rules
* knowledge
* transparency

Based on these items this dataset provides new indices on formal independence and expert proficiency, allowing researchers to investigate the roots and effectiveness of fiscal monitoring and its effects on the fiscal performance of national governments more thoroughly.

**Coverage**

The CifiD covers expert bodies with a legal monitoring mandate in thirty-nine countries, inlcuding legistalive changes to that mandate.
